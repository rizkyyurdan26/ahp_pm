This research using method ahp and profile matching to determine land suitability for maize varieties

What the explain of each folders?
1. folder "clean" contain climate data which cleaned
2. folder "dataset" contain :
    a. "bobot ahp" contains AHP weight from each parameter
    b. "dataset",  contains original data 
    c. "split data" contains data that used in research
    d. datasets which not in children folder, that are combine for all data cleaned befor split
3. file "data_ lahan.ipynb" for cleaning land dataset
4. file "data_varietas.ipynb" for cleaning varieties dataset
5. file "data_split.ipynb" for spliting dataset to each parameters
6. file "DSS_Combine.ipynb", its cobine from all function that separated. And this file is DSS Model that used in this research
7. file "pearson.ipynb", it is for validating tes from quesioner evaluate
8. Other file ".ipynb", that are experiment from each method that used

Warning:

If you want use this DSS model to your research or other experiment, Please don't only copy and paste this code. 
You must add more parameter or dataset, make my research only on of your references, not only one reference.
